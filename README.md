# Project 3: Teal Together
by Jenny Agagas

# project overview
My project is based on creating a festival centering awereness and fundraising for Ovarian Cancer Research. It's important to raise more awareness towards this disease because all women
are vulnerable to it. Ovarian cancer happens when cells in a woman's ovaries grow out of control and start to harm healthy tissue. Women have two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus, which make eggs and hormones. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. It's nickname "the silent killer" is because the disease can often carry no symptons until it becomes too advanced for treatment. 

My project aims to raise awareness about this issue, encouraging women to pay closer attention to the symptoms and seek medical help when necessary, to prevent it from developing into a more serious problem. It also fosters community bringing families together to support this cause and the women in their life that have gone through treatment, currently batteling this disease, and bring overall awareness. 

# technical overview

This project will include multiple pages about this event that will take place on Dec 8-10 in Santa Cruz. Each link will highlight each day with the events, how to support the cause, and tickets or merchandise for purchase.
