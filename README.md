# Project 3: Teal Together
by Jenny Agagas

# project overview
Partnered with the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (OCRA), Teal Together is a festival to raise awareness and funds for ovarian cancer research. By teaming up with OCRA, every dollar we raise goes directly to support groundbreaking research and services for those affected by Ovarian Cancer. It's important to raise more awareness about this disease because all women
are vulnerable to it. Ovarian cancer happens when cells in a woman's ovaries grow out of control and start to harm healthy tissue.

This event is not just about having fun; it's about making a difference. Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until it's advanced, earning it the nickname "the silent killer." Our festival aims to change that by educating women about the symptoms and empowering them to seek help early.
Beyond raising awareness, our festival brings communities together to support those battling ovarian cancer and honor those who have fought bravely. It's a time to unite, celebrate life, and work towards a future where ovarian cancer is no longer a threat. Together, we can make a real impact in the fight against this disease.
